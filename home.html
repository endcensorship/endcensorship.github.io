            <h2>What is Censorship?</h2>
            <p>
                According to the Oxford dictionary, censorship is "the suppression or prohibition of any parts of books, films, news, etc. that are considered obscene, politically unacceptable, or a threat to security." This raises the question though, who decides what is obscene, what is politically unacceptable, and what counts as a threat to security?
            </p>
            <p>
                The American Civil Liberties Union provides a better definition in their article "What is Censorship," they say that censorship is "the suppression of words, images, or ideas that are “offensive,” happens whenever some people succeed in imposing their personal political or moral values on others." This definition succeeds where the other fails as it highlights the fact that censorship is a tool of those in power to silence the opposition.
