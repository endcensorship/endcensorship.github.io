            <h2>Content Moderation</h2> <!--Introduction Section-->
            <p>
                It's a common occurrence unfortunately for activists on social media, our posts are flagged as inappropriate, moderators claim we are breaking community guidelines. When we organize protests they claim we are inciting violence, when we post about our queer bodies they claim we are posting explicit content. Transition timelines are taken down, people of color are banned for posting a selfie, queer artists have their work flagged. All the while the people who harass us receive no punishment.
            </p>
            <p>
                We make appeals, try to get our accounts, our posts, our online existence returned to us; sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. It's not all bad though, like I mentioned before the internet is a big place and can be an excellent way to find a community. Communities where LGBTQ, BIPOC, and disabled people can share our struggles, get advice, and organize resistance. We can meet lifelong friends from the opposite side of the world, people who are just like us.
            </p>
            <p>
                The road to a safer, more inclusive internet does not include restrictive laws and restrictions, it starts with community.
