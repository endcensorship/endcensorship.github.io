            <h2>Content Moderation</h2> <!--Introduction Section-->
            <p>
                Oftentimes, social media sites target LGBTQ and BIPOC communities through moderation of "inappropriate" content. They falsely label posts featuring queer and BIPOC bodies or discussions as "sexual," or remove posts advocating for or organizing protests as "inciting violence." All the while the fail to remove blatant hate speech and take no action to protect queer and BIPOC users from harassment.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Sites such as Facebook are notorious for their targeting of queer communities through this method. One example of this is MPact, a gay health and rights coalition, which had their <a href="https://www.poz.com/blog/online-censorship">facebook account depublished</a>, essentially hidden from other users, in 2021. Facebook and Instagram were also widely criticized in 2017 when they hosted misinformation ads that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/russian-operatives-used-facebook-ads-to-exploit-divisions-over-black-political-activism-and-muslims/2017/09/25/4a011242-a21b-11e7-ade1-76d061d56efa_story.html">advocated for anti-black and anti-muslim violence</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Meta is not the only social media platform with these problems, Tumblr for example, often praised for its large queer user-base, has had issues with transphobic moderators for a long time. In early 2024, Tumblr staff falsely flagged a popular trans users transition timeline as sexually explicit, this same user had received zero support from staff for the harassment she had been facing from transphobic users on the site. I was unable to find proof one way or the other, but some sources, claim that when Tumblr banned several Russian bot accounts in 2018, some of the accounts were not bots but Black users who had been active on the site for years.

            <h2>KOSA</h2>
            <p>
                One topic that is relevant at the moment is KOSA, the Kids Online Safety Act, which was introduced to US congress in 2022. While the bill was initially rejected, it was reintroduced in may of 2023 and has yet to be passed (as of April 2024). The alleged goal of KOSA is to protect children from potentially seeing harmful content on the internet. The reason that this is such a hot topic is that this bill would allow the government to influence what content social media sites are allowed to host as well as ramping up online surveillance.
            </p>
            <p>
                The "stopkosa" movement led by the "Fight for the Future" organization say on their website that "KOSA won’t make kids more safe. Instead, it’ll put youth in danger by preventing them from accessing resources they need." By blocking children's access to LGBTQ content as well as increasing parental control, the bill would put many queer kids at risk of abuse.

            <h2>How to help</h2>
            <p>
                The best thing that you can do right now is check out the organizations page and see what is being advocated for there. Beyond that, just be aware and spread the word. Educate your friends and family on the dangers of censorship, listen to the voices of queer and BIPOC users, make sure no act of censorship goes unknown. If we do our part in uplifting the voices of the victims, we can overpower their attempts at silencing us. The road to a safer internet starts with community, by raising our voices together we can make our demands heard and protect the freedom that is found online.
