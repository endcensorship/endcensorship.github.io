            <h2>Protecting Kids?</h2>
            <p>
                The most common reason used to justify banning books is to protect children from reading about inappropriate content. Concerned parents and politicians will go through the trouble of challenging books, convincing school and library board members to remove certain books from their collections. Unsurprisingly, what these parents and politicians label as "inappropriate" is more often than not queer and BIPOC stories.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just glancing over the <a href="https://www.ala.org/advocacy/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks/top10">Top Ten Most Challenged Books of 2023</a> list is enough to prove that book banning targets queer and BIPOC content disproportionally. Just the top three are sufficient really, <i>Gender Queer: A Memoir</i> by Maia Kobabe is an exploration of life as a gender queer person. <i>All Boys Aren’t Blue</i> by George M. Johnson is a memoir about Johnson's life as a Black Queer man. Lastly <i>This Book is Gay</i> by Juno Dawson is an educational book that sets out to teach queer kids what their schools failed to teach them about being queer. Banning these books isn't protecting children at all, just preventing them from being represented in what they read, preventing them from learning about themselves and people like them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The people who challenge these books know this though, it's the entire point. It's not about protecting kids at all, it's about silencing LGBTQ and BIPOC voices and preventing children from learning about being queer. This fact points out the fatal flaw in censorship of any form, that no matter what, it will be used by those in power to silence those they find undesirable. Plus the entire idea of "protecting" kids like this is white and christian; what kids should and shouldn't be taught varies greatly between different cultures and parenting styles.

            <h2>Fighting Back</h2>
            <p>
                With book banning attempts ramping up in the past few years, it's more important than ever to fight back. The best way to do that is to organize as a community and make our voices heard. The effectiveness of this method was proven recently in Glen Ridge New Jersey where the community rallied to prevent the banning of six books that featured queer content. The small group that was pushing for the books to be banned made an appeal to the Library Director, leading to a Board of Trustee's meeting in February of 2023. In response to this attempt, members of the Glen Ridge community banded together and showed up in mass to advocate for keeping the books on the shelves.

                One of the books that was challenged was <i>All Boys Aren’t Blue</i>, mentioned earlier. The author, George M. Johnson, sent along a statement to be read at the meeting in which he explained why the claims about his book were false. He highlights the fact that preventing teens from learning about heavy topics will only harm them in the future, and that providing them access to queer stories could save their lives. He asks those in favor of banning whether "in this hunt to protect teens, [has] it ever cross your mind that removing or restricting this life-saving story for LGBTQ students only harms them more? Or how removing this life-saving story for Black teens harms them?" He continues by saying "[b]ut you do not care, because that’s really what this fight is over—removing LGBTQ stories and Black stories."
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks to the work of the community, the appeal was denied and the books stayed on the shelves. More details and Johnson's full statement can be read in <a href="https://www.slj.com/story/All-Boys-Arent-Blue-Author-George-M-Johnsons-Mom-Joins-Attendees-Speaking-Out-Against-Book-Banning-Attempt-in-NJ">this article</a>. Glen Ridge is just one of many success stories, all across the country communities and authors are fighting back against censorship. These fights are an important reminder of the power of our collective voices.
