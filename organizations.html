            <h2><a href="https://glaad.org/" class="organization">GLAAD</a></h2>
            <p>
                From their website: <br>Founded in 1985, GLAAD is a non-profit organization focused on LGBTQ advocacy and cultural change. GLAAD works to ensure fair, accurate, and inclusive representation and creates national and local programs that advance LGBTQ acceptance. Serving as a storyteller, media force, resource, and advocate, GLAAD tackles tough issues and provokes dialogue so that authentic LGBTQ stories are seen, heard, and actualized. GLAAD strives to protect all that has been accomplished and helps create a world where everyone can live the life they love.
            </p>

            <p>
                As GLAAD is a very large organization with many overarching goals, they are a great place for getting information on any queer movement. For online-censorship, they create a <a href="https://glaad.org/publications/social-media-safety-index-2023/">Safety Index</a> each year that measures how queer friendly different social media platforms are. They advocate for more hate speech protections, improving moderation systems including better training and oversight, stronger privacy protections, and transparency about user data collection and use.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the topic of book banning, they provide the following recommendations for community action (taken from <a href="https://glaad.org/book-bans-cannot-stand-organizing-to-defeat-book-bans-in-your-community/">this article</a>):
                <ul>
                    <li>Organize a diverse local coalition including students and GSA (Genders and Sexualities Alliances, AKA Gay-Straight Alliances) leaders, parents, teachers, librarians, LGBTQ advocates, authors, health professionals and clergy.</li>
                    <li>Create fact-based and meaningful messages to inform and inspire all in the community and present to school and library boards.</li>
                    <li>Engage news, social and local media with facts and local interview voices and resources.</li>
                    <li>Inform all in the community including families, businesses, elected officials and taxpayers about the threat of book bans to LGBTQ and ally youth and the entire community’s safety, prosperity and reputation.  </li>
                    <li>Hold school and library boards accountable to all taxpayers, ensure proper protocol is being followed in book reconsiderations, and demand necessary reforms to end the skyrocketing and discriminatory wave of book banning.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                GLAAD also has a <a href="https://give.glaad.org/page/51921/donate/1">donation page</a> and volunteer events which are good ways to support the movement.

            <h2><a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/" class="organization">Fight for the Future</a></h2>
            <p>
                From their website:<br> We are a group of artists, engineers, activists, and technologists who have been behind the largest online protests in human history, channeling Internet outrage into political power to win public interest victories previously thought to be impossible. We fight for a future where technology is a force for liberation— not oppression.
            </p>

            <p>
                Fight for the Future is behind the <a href="https://www.stopkosa.com/">Stop KOSA</a> project, which aims to stop KOSA from being passed through congress. The Stop KOSA project is a great place to start fighting back against censorship, they provide a super easy form that you can fill out in less than 30 seconds that sends an email to your representatives. The website also provides plenty of information on the potential harms of the bill and a list of organizations that oppose it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I very much recommend taking 30 seconds to sign that petition, if you want more, Fight for the Future also has a <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/donate/?frequency=monthly">donation page</a>.

            <h2><a class="organization" href="https://www.ala.org/">American Library Association</a></h2>
            <p>
                From their website:<br> The American Library Association (ALA) is the oldest and largest library association in the world. Founded on October 6, 1876 during the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, the mission of ALA is “to provide leadership for the development, promotion and improvement of library and information services and the profession of librarianship in order to enhance learning and ensure access to information for all.”
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                ALA has been advocating for equal access to knowledge for a long time, and thus is a great place for learning about book banning. They provide many different anti-censorship services such as a yearly list of banned books (the 2023 list can be found <a href="https://www.ala.org/advocacy/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks/top10">here</a>), general statistics, they run a "banned books week" for spreading awareness, and a service for reporting censorship. The censorship reporting service provides a way for librarians to gather support from the broader community in response to local censorship attempts.
            </p>
            <p>
                ALA provides many more services related to censorship and anything to do with access to literature, they have a <a href="https://ec.ala.org/donate">donation link</a>! ALA also has volunteer positions available plus student and employment support, I recommend giving their website a look through.
